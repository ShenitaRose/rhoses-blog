            When Traci learnt that she was the last of the Springstons she was distraught.It couldnt be real. Everything 
            that she thought she knew was a lie. It was all Lies. Traci was raised in an orphanage since she was a little girl.Everything she thought she knew was just uncovered and now it was as if her existence was in vain. Traci's mother, Victoria was a witch. A very powerful witch who had commited some crimes against the crown . It was dicovered that she was a part of a coven that was plotting the overthrow of Queen Eugenia the third.When nes of her plans got back to the crown and it was discovered who she really was, the Queen passed a decree that all witches were to be found and burnt at the steak in front of witnesses. The great lesson being that anyone who dared threaten the seat of the queen would meet their untimely fate. Traci's mother was found guilty of her crimes but the day before she was to be burned she had given birth to a child who she named Persephone. Upon learning that she was to die, she took the baby and left her at the steps of the orphange and fled. Victoria was  never found and no one knew about the magical baby except for her.No one knows if Victoria is alive or dead but after all these years one can only presume that she is.
            Traci wept at the story of her mother. Why had her mother run away and left her behind? Why didn't she take her along? All Traci knew was that now, she was alone.

            Traci receives a call from a Lawyer who provides details and key information about her past.This information unlocks a world of answers that Traci needed.Now that she knows where she originates, it's time to make a promise and create a legacy. The Springston name will live on for many years to come.Traci had inherited the house that her mother owned, with the funds that she had inherited, she revamped the place and turned it into a habitation for the many generations that she plans to have.After the renovationms were complete, Traci found that she was, well, BROKE. She quickly applied for a job as a journalist as this was something that she always wanted to do.
            Someday, she hopes to write her own novel about her legacy

            Traci has been talking to a penpal that she has had for years and it has brought her a sense of calm.Not only was he understanding but he was also handsome! That is always a good thing.
            She finally decided to meet with Anton. Infact, Traci and Anton have been meeting atleast 4 times a week for about 2 months now. Things were starting to move at a pace that was rather fast and Traci felt as though she had found a companion in Anton. She confided in him for alot of things. She was comfortable enough to tell him about all the things she has been through. it seemed as though Anton had the same feelings that she had for him as he was starting to project feelings of romance towards her. Was this a step in the right direction? Should she ask him to be more that friends? These are the questions that plagued her daily but she was willing to take the necessary steps to make it happen.That was until Anton surpised her in a way that she had not seen coming.

            This is not how Traci was hoping for everything to go down but one thing was quite sure and set in stone, she loved Anton. If she was to spend the rest of her days with someone ,she was going to do it with the one person who she knew was just as into her as she was into them.
            Without thinking, Traci accepted the weird yet wonderful proposal.I guess you can say she found love in a hopeless place
